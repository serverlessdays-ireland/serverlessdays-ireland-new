ServerlessDays are a family of events around the world focused on fostering a community around serverless technologies.

ServerlessDays began as JeffConf, a tongue in cheek conference in the spirit of Paul Johnston’s blog post, “Serverless is just a name. We could have called it Jeff”, an attempt to move beyond the serverless buzzword and focus on the practical use of function as a service platforms and the value they provide. It is a one day, community focused, single track event centered on real world serverless-based solutions. It’s about fostering a community and helping all of us learn from each other as we embrace a new way of building applications.

Each ServerlessDay is unique, and The Ireland chapter of ServerlessDays is unique, organised by members from all the other chapters accross Ireland and not run for profit. They are run according to the following principles:

Local: run by local community organisers
Accessible: financially and physically accessible to the community
Representative: representative of the broader community within which it exists
We follow and enforce the ServerlessDays Code of Conduct.
